                Dictionary Cracking utilizes a dictionary list which contains common words, and phrases, many of which are derived from a dictionary. These dictionary list will then be used to guess the password to gain access to a resource. It succeeds due to the fact that many people use very simple, easy to remember passwords or provide minor or slight variations to commonly used words like p@assw0rd. Some of the common variables that are placed in a dictionary list are things such as, company names, regional sport teams, team names, catch phrases and many other common naming conventions that people use for their passwords.

                Most list span over a couple gigabytes or even terabytes to increase the potential of success, hackers simply increase the size and variability of each guess. Though most good hackers would build a dictionary list to specifically target organizations or individuals and would conduct basic background checks on said users. This way they are able to leverage on the information that they have gained to make more accurate guesses. If an organizations name is “Singapore Clockworks” and is located in Singapore, the guesses would be something along the lines of “SGClock1234”, “cLoCkSG2022” or “SingCW2022”.
