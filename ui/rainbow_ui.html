            Rainbow Table Cracking involves the usage of a rainbow table to crack a password. In modern day applications and databases, passwords are not stored in plaintext, but instead are hashed. How the cracking works, is very similar to dictionary attacks, where it is a simple comparison to stored hashes within a database. Once is match is found, the password is cracked.

            Firstly, let us understand what a hashing is. To put it in simple terms, it is a one-way algorithm that changes the plaintext into a non-readable format. This is so that users who have stolen or view the information will not be able to access that account. Have a try in the exercise below.
