                Brute Force Cracking is the process of forcefully attempting passwords by cycling through all possible inputs that are possible. The way most brute force tools work, is that it contains a set of characters e.g (a-z) and it would cycle through each letter for each possible input. An example is the first guess would be “aaaa” and the second guess would be “aaab”. From there it would cycle through each possible iteration of input and would eventually land on a correct one, the core variable being the length of the password and its complexity. With length playing a significant role in the time it takes to crack.
