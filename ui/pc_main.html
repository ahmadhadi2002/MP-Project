                Password Cracking is the process of cracking or determining a password using a variety of programmatic techniques and specialized tools.  The goal of this learner-portal is to teach you, the user on the processes behind password cracking and the importance of a strong password to secure your information should a breach occur. We are here to equip you with the knowledge of understanding the concepts of password cracking, though the exercises and scenario does not fully reflect the complete inner workings of an real attack. It will allow you to understand key aspects and points that attackers will require to crack a password.

            <p class="textcenter">
                Starting off with the basics, what are passwords? In most scenarios passwords refer to a string of secret characters that is used to authenticate and authorize a user to access a resource/service with usernames acting as a form of identity. Passwords are an essential part of security in today’s world, with almost all application requiring some form of identification and authorization, be it a company email, learner web-portal, company VPN, and many other services.

                This type of news is frequenting more and more in todays headlines, but has anyone ever stopped to asked what happens now or what will they do with ‘encrypted’ information? This is where password cracking comes in. Attackers will employ many methods to crack and access the plaintext passwords of accounts but, before that, we must understand databases.  Before a password is stored within a database, it is most commonly ‘salted’ and ‘hashed’ utilizing complex one-way algorithms, meaning that once something is hashed it is impossible to reverse it to its original plaintext. From there the passwords will be transported to a database which will encrypt the information further to prevent anyone from reading the stored hash in plaintext form.

            <p class="textcenter">   
                These are the common practices that many companies use, and it is viewed as the industry standard for protecting data. This begs the question; how do hackers obtain the plaintext password from such security measures?

            <!-- <h2 class="textheader">Common Types of Password Cracking</h2>
            <p class="textcenter">
            We will go through 3 common types of password cracking that we will go further in depth within each respective activity page.

            <p class="smallheader">Dictionary Cracking</p>
            <p class="textcenter">
                Starting off with the simplest form of cracking which is dictionary cracking, which involves making a comparison to pre-existing libraries that span up to hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes where it contains a series of either hashes or plaintext words to make comparisons to with a stored password. These types of attacks usually focuses on users who do not make complex passwords and use simple everyday words or slight variations of it as passwords.
            </p>
            <p class="textcenter">
                All that’s left is to find a match between the database and the stolen information for an attacker to gain access to that account.

            <p class="smallheader">Brute Force Cracking</p>
            <p class="textcenter">
                Brute Force cracking refers to a form of cracking that guesses through possible iteration of characters ranging from “a-z” both in small and capital letters. Brute force cracking is one of the more commonly used tactics when attempting to guess a password, due to its ability to guess relatively complex strings of characters. Only down side is the exponential need for computing power based on the length of the password, with each additional character adding a couple million of billions of possibilities.

            <p class="textcenter">
                This is an example of the calculated guess work of brute force cracking and its utility in guessing a relatively complex password.
