A method to encode information in a way making it unreadable without a secret
key. This process transforms plaintext into ciphertext via an encryption algorithm
and a secret key. The resulting ciphertext can only be deciphered and transformed back into the
original plaintext through the usage of appropriate decryption key. The purpose of encryption is to
protect
sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft or tampering, and to ensure the privacy and
confidentiality of the information being transmitted or stored.
