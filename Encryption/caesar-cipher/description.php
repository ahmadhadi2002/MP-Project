            <p style="font-size:18px">The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique in which each letter in the
              plain text
              is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The number of positions the letters are shifted
              by is
              known as the key. The Caesar Cipher is easily broken and is not considered secure for modern
              communications, but
              it was used historically as a way of obscuring text. Currently, it served as an educational purpose to
              educate
              people on cryptography.</p>

              Caesar cipher named after Julius Caesar, who, used it with a shift of three (Encrypting: A -> D,
              Decrypting: D ->
              A) to protect messages of military significance according to Suetonius. While
              Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used
              earlier.
              <br>
              Being one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique, till this day it has been used
              beside
              depsite being one of the oldest cryptography. Examples would be the personal
              advertisements section in newspapers in the 19th Century would used it something to exchange messages
              encrypted
              using simple cipher schemes or lovers while enging in secret communications.
              <br>
              Even as late as 1915, Caesar cipher was in use bythe Russian army as a replacement for a
              complicated ciphers proved to pose difficulties for their troops to master. Even the German and Austrian
              cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.
              <br>
              Many of the cipher technique has referenced to Caesar Cipher such as Vigen√®re Cipher and ROT13.

            <b>Encryption:</b><br>
            An integer value to cipher a given text, it isknown as a shift indicating the number of positions each
            letter of the text would be moved either down or up.
            The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers,
            according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1, till Z = 25. Encryption of a letter by a shift n can be described
            mathematically as follows:
