    <h2><u>What is Caesar Cipher?</u></h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px">The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique in which each letter in the plain text
      is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. The number of positions the letters are shifted by is
      known as the key. The Caesar Cipher is easily broken and is not considered secure for modern communications, but
      it was used historically as a way of obscuring text. Currently, it served as an educational purpose to educate
      people on cryptography.</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<h2><u> Background (brief)</u></h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px">
      Caesar cipher named after Julius Caesar, who, used it with a shift of three (Encrypting: A -> D, Decrypting: D ->
      A) to protect messages of military significance according to Suetonius. While
      Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used
      earlier.
      <br>
      Being one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique, till this day it has been used beside
      depsite being one of the oldest cryptography. Examples would be the personal
      advertisements section in newspapers in the 19th Century would used it something to exchange messages encrypted
      using simple cipher schemes or lovers while enging in secret communications.
      <br>
      Even as late as 1915, Caesar cipher was in use bythe Russian army as a replacement for a
      complicated ciphers proved to pose difficulties for their troops to master. Even the German and Austrian
      cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.
      <br>
      Many of the cipher technique has referenced to Caesar Cipher such as Vigen√®re Cipher and ROT13.

      <b>Encryption:</b><br>
      An integer value to cipher a given text, it isknown as a shift indicating the number of positions each
      letter of the text would be moved either down or up.
      The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers,
      according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1, till Z = 25. Encryption of a letter by a shift n can be described
      mathematically as follows:

      Just apply the given shift in the opposite direction to decrypt the original text or use the cyclic
      property of the cipher under modulo, hence, the obersvation can be made is:
