        <h1 style="font-size: 35px">ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)</h1>
        <p style="font-size:18px">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that
            uses either 128, 192, or 256 bit keys to transform a 128 bit block of plaintext into ciphertext. The AES
            algorithm uses a substitution-permutation network with several rounds to generate ciphertext, with the
            number of rounds determined by the key length. It uses a 4x4 grid of bytes/bits instead of a one-line
            arrangement like most ciphers. AES was selected as the successor to the outdated Data Encryption Standard
            (DES) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2000 after a public competition and
            fierce cryptanalysis by leading encryption specialists. In 2003, it was approved for use with Secret and Top
            Secret classified information of the U.S. government.</p>

        <h2><u>Background</u></h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px">The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was becoming vulnerable to brute-force attacks,
            leading the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) to require a newer and more secure standard.
            NIST announced a competition for the successor to DES, which was won by the Rijndael algorithm of Belgian
            cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen in 2000 after three rounds of competition and analysis by
            leading encryption specialists. AES was selected for its perfect combination of security, performance,
            efficiency, implementability, and flexibility.</p>

        <h2><u>Process</u></h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px">AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses the same key for encryption and
            decryption. The AES encryption process involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Key Generation - A key of 128, 192, or 256 bits is generated for encryption and decryption.</li>
            <li>Initialization Vector (IV) Generation - An IV of 128 bits is generated to add randomness and avoid
                repetition in the encryption process.</li>
            <li>Add Round Key - The plaintext is XORed with the first round key.</li>
            <li>Main Rounds - The encryption process consists of 10, 12, or 14 rounds of transformations (depending on
                the key size), each consisting of four transformations: Substitute Bytes (SubBytes), Shift Rows, Mix
                Columns, and Add Round Key.</li>
            <li>Final Round - The final round consists of the same transformations as the main rounds, except without
                the Mix Columns step.</li>
        </ol>
